# [feat] backEndCountry()

> Build an app that simulates a single page experience (the item detail page) in a service oriented style where each service is responsible for delivering the content+data for one module on the page. The modules will be linked together on a master layout, called a proxy server, and all modules must coordinate and work together to present content for a given item ID or item name. Each team member will build their own proxy server that consumes their module and all of their teammates' modules.
